# pathGrid
pathGrid is a set of scripts and functions that calculates and plots statistics of great circle paths on a geodetic grid.

The purpose of this project is to detect regions of attenuation of very-low-frequency (VLF) radio waves in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide, caused by
extreme solar flares, using VLF waves launched by lightning strokes and detected by the [World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN)](wwlln.net).  Results of this
technique, applied to the solar storm of September 2017, were presented at the February 2019 AGU Chapman Conference on "Challenges Related to Space Weather Forecasting Including Extremes", and published in the accompanying special issue of *Space Weather*:

October 8 2020: This project is not currently being developed, but I intend to add documentation and ports of the more broadly-applicable code to Python and Julia.
