# pathGrid
pathGrid is a set of scripts and functions that calculates and plots statistics of great circle paths on a geodetic grid.

The purpose of this project is to detect regions of attenuation of very-low-frequency (VLF) radio waves in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide, caused by
extreme solar flares, using VLF waves launched by lightning strokes and detected by the [World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN)](wwlln.net).  Results of this
technique, applied to the solar storm of September 2017, were presented at the February 2019 AGU Chapman Conference on "Challenges Related to Space Weather Forecasting Including Extremes", and published in the accompanying special issue of *Space Weather*:

October 12, 2021: The next updates to this project will be:

1. automatically running the analysis in real time on a WWLLN server,
2. incorporating and analyzing sferic dispersion, and
3. cleaning up documentation and packaging a release.

Ideally these updates will be ready by the end of November.  If you want to try this out with your own data, send me a message and I'll help you get started!
